# Sync and Async

We recommend most production deployments to have **two** rule sets.

### The sync ruleset

The **sync** ruleset is used to affect live actions. It is evaluated while the user is still waiting for a response, and as such needs to be *fast*. Exactly how fast on what you want your response times to be. A social networks might want less than *100ms*, but in the case of payments even *5000ms* is acceptable for improved accuracy. Results of rules firing here might mean blocked signups, displaying captchas or phone verification.

For this if your application is written in Node.js you could just `require('sqrl')` directly. For other applications SQRL comes with an out of the box [server deployment](server.html) that you can use as a micro-service.

### The async ruleset

A slower **async** ruleset is used especially when the required response time of the **sync** ruleset is very low. These rules scan events *after* they have happened and do more complicated analysis. The actions that may be taken here are putting the content up for manual review, and adding labels that the **sync** ruleset may use to block future actions.

Most async implementations use a [message queue deployment](queue.html)
